The sides are being chosen.

384
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,888
And everyone you love
will be destroyed.

389
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,844
Lost six pints of blood.

390

Normal person dies at four.

391
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,947
We're shipping her back
to our black site.

392
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,650
-She may not make it.
-But did her story check out?

393
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,184
We confirmed
the shooting downtown,

394
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:38,819
but her tech wasn't there.

395
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:41,522
And whoever took it
now has an electronic arsenal.

396
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:44,558
-You've alerted your people?
-Yeah, Mia and Brian are safe.

397
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:47,628
I tried to get in touch
with Roman, Tej, Ramsey, Han.

398
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,831
-No answer.
-Any idea where they might be?

399
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,902
In Rome.

400
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,704
Working for you.

401
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:59,640
Dom, we don't... we don't have
a mission in Rome.

402
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,209
It's a setup.

403
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,245
Shit.

404
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,614
We're going to Rome.

-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

407
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:19,459
Son, you and I will finish
that driving lesson.

408

It's a promise.

409
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,700
No matter what happens.

410
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,035

Ah! Found it.

537
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:48,956
I can disarm it
with an agency kill switch.

538
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:50,991
I just need physical hands
on the device.

539
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,893
-We have to stop that truck.
-Sorry, Captain America.

540
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:54,395
Can't let you do that.

541
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:59,833
LETTY: <i>We got to hurry!</i>
<i>The truck is speeding up.</i>

542
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:03,437
-We got to block its path.
-I'm gonna get ahead of it.

543
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,006
Ramsey, Tej, strap in.

544
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,244
Whoop.

545
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:13,280
(groaning)

546
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:15,149
(purrs)

547
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,288
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

548
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,161
Dom, go ahead! I'm pinched!

549
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:29,963
Dominic.

550
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,133
Come on!

551
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:36,236
Damn it, he's fast.

552
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,279
Really? The clothesline?

553
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:46,614
Well, we can't drive it,

554
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,382
guess we're just
gonna have to roll it.

555
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:55,289
(Ramsey grunts)

556
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:03,897
(both screaming)

557
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:10,572
LETTY: Holy shit! The truck's
about to go over the hill!

558
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:13,240
-We have to crash into it.
-We have to what?!

559
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,946
-(grunts)
-(screams)

560
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:25,386
(tires squealing)

561
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:30,090
I'm so sorry, my gold baby!

562
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:33,160
<i>It's not stopping!</i>

563
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:36,997
HAN:
<i>Dom, the bomb is out.</i>

564
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:42,136
Everybody, stay clear.
I got this.

565
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:44,037
No. We got this.

566
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,952
Letty!

567
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,565
(people screaming)

568
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,166
Have we made them all
terrorists?

569
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,601
Their images have been
fed to the authorities.

570
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:16,103
All right, Bob!
I got to go kill that jerk

571
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:17,672
that's trying to disarm my bomb.

572
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:19,406
It's always something, you know?
Oh.

573
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,443
Remember, I still have your
families, so don't go anywhere.

574
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,461
(sirens wailing)

575
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:42,496
(urgent chatter in Italian)

576
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:47,000
(shouts angrily in Italian)

577
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:58,212
<i>Buongiorno, Roma!</i>

578
00:32:58,245 --> 00:32:59,614
All right.

579
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,181
(engine starts)

580
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,687
-(radio static squealing)
-(Dante singing in Italian)

581
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,723
(singing continues)

582
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,592
Man, who the hell is that?

583
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,159
(chuckles):
Hey! There he is!

584
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,428
Man of the hour.
Roman Pearce, team leader.

585
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:17,164
Can't wait to see you
get out of this one. (laughs)

586
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:19,567
(people screaming)

587
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,439
DANTE (singsongy):
Oh, Letty!

588
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:27,742
LETTY:
I think I found our guy.

589
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:29,711
Hey, Letty. <i>Vaffanculo!</i>

590
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:30,812
(blows raspberries)

591
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,412
I'm on him.

592
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,428
That pump's gonna blow.

593
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,468
-(people screaming)
-(grunts)

594
00:33:56,504 --> 00:33:58,540
(screams)

595
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:09,449
(laughs)

596
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,589
-(tires screeching)
-(people shouting)

597
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:42,584
DOM:
<i>Little Nobody, you're up.</i>

598
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:43,685
-(mutters)
-(horn honks)

599
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,425
-Moving to dis...
-Peekaboo!

600
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,126
(laughs)

601
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,604
-Get out of there!
It's gonna blow! -Oh, shit.

602
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,807
(rapid beeping)

603
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,474
-Boom.
-(grunts)

604
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:18,418
(officer shouts)

605
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,524
(people clamoring)

606
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,267
(tires squealing)

607
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:41,676
(people screaming)

608
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:58,158
(barking)

609
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:10,270
We need to jam
the detonator now.

610
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:12,439
I got it, I got it.
Letty, don't lose him.

611
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,476
I can lock on to your location
and transmit

612
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:18,278
cellular interference
through your phone.

613
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,715
That should jam his detonator
and buy us some time.

614
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:25,787
Letty.

615
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:31,324
(people screaming)

616
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:34,629
(grunts)

617
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:44,371
(laughs)

618
00:37:00,822 --> 00:37:02,724
(grunts)

619
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:05,492
(tires screeching)

620
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:09,764
Bravo!

621
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:11,264
It's getting tricky, guys.

622
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,934
I can't stay on him
for much longer.

623
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,869
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

624
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,938
The Tiber? Uh...

625
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:18,506
Uh, 60 feet.

626
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:19,974
I mean, the water could
smother the explosion,

627
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,342
reduce its power
by ten times, maybe.

628
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,846
(sputtering radio static)

629
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,485
(sirens wailing)

630
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:38,358
-(woman gasps)
-(officers shouting)

631
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:40,494
LETTY:
Damn it!

632
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:44,498
(laughs) You missed me
by that much, baby!

633
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:45,633
(laughs)

634
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,602
(grunts)

635
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:50,370
I lost him. He's gone.

636
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:51,773
-TEJ: Damn!
-(device beeping)

637
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:52,907
He's out of our reach.

638
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,509
We can't jam the signal anymore.

639
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:57,444
Bad news, Dom.
I'm back in business.

640
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,313
(beeping)

641
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,590
You got 30 seconds to save Rome.

642
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:15,563
RAMSEY: <i>Dom, he armed the bomb,</i>
<i>and you're almost at the river.</i>

643
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:33,581
(sighs)

644
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:41,289
(horns blaring)

645
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,559
(grunts)

646
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:50,965
DANTE:
15 seconds, Dom.

647
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,134
Dom, listen to me.

648
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,735
The Vatican's within
the blast radius.

649
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:56,070
Get out of there.

650
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:57,805
<i>You've done</i>
<i>everything you could.</i>

651
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,607
Not everything.
